Aufgabe:

You can represent a tree as a list of list, e.g. [[1], [2, 3], [4, [5, 6, [7, 8, [9, [10, 11,
12]]]]]]. Implement a function flatten(tree) that flattens a tree. The sample tree would then
be turned into the following list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Hint: using a yield
expression and a yield from expression, your code will be less than 10 lines.
